```Requires Gaffer 0.58.1.0```

###### All tools presented here are based solely on examples shared on the [Gaffer community mailing list](https://www.gafferhq.org/community/)

## Setup 
#### Before you start
Unzip the barbershop alembic file `/barbershop/abc/babershop_interior.abc.tar.7z`.   
Alternatively you can run `expand-assets.sh` to unzip it using `file-roller`.

#### Enviroment Variables
`source gaffer-examples.sh` before running gaffer.  
Alternatively set those environments in your system manually.

#### Dependencies

[LDTGaffer](https://github.com/ezequielmastrasso/LDTGaffer) is required for this examples.   
If you would rather have the LDTGaffer repo in a different location:   
Comment the line "source LDTGaffer/LDTGaffer.sh", and source both .sh from the repositories before running gaffer.

#### Gaffer Version
Requires 0.58.1.0 or above.

## Templates
    Note on GPU render: Ai User Data String and Trace Sets are not supported
    in GPU render.
    Shots Template: Turn the barbershop Reference Node gpu_uncompat_nodes Off.
    Asset Template: Prune the Shader balls reference.

## Contribute
### Help needed!
Do you feel like:
* helping with assets surfacing or lighting Setups?
* sharing cool tricks, examples, templates, or workflows?
* improve the templates?
* helping translating the Assets and lighting to [Gaffer Cycles](https://github.com/boberfly/GafferCycles)?

#### How to Contribute
Before you start, contact us and let us know what you want to work on.  
Certain things -such as asset surfacing, and lighting updates- will need to be handled case by case, to ensure a smooth conflict-free update in the main files.  

[Fork, clone, branch, work, push, pull request as usual.](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)  

#### Style guide
[Examples style guide](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/wiki/Examples-Style-Guide)

##### Extra styling
###### Styling Exceptions
Where nodes are Shots or Sequence based, for better readability  we prefix these nodes with `SEQ0001`  for exampe `SEQ0001_RenderQuality` or `SEQ0001_SHO0002`
###### Icons
Icons are placed in /resources/icons.
To set a Node's icon, open the Node's EditUI window and set the Node icon as `/assets/resources/icons/iconName.png`
###### IconScale
You can set the Node's iconScale using the code snippet below.   
The values used in the templates are `3.0`, `5.0` or `7.0`, depending on the node importance.
Only Box Nodes are scaled.
```
import Gaffer
node = root['LDTTurnTable']
Gaffer.Metadata.registerValue (node, 'iconScale', 7.0)
```
